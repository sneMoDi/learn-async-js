Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

Because both invocations of the sum function are asynchronous, they are processed simultaneously. Consequently, when an error occurs more quickly, it is promptly rejected and logged first. 
Conversely, the computation of the actual array sum requires some time, leading to its delayed printing.
